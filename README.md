## Motivation 
<a name="motivation"></a>
Being a group of students in a coding bootcamp, we wanted to create a project that was relevant to us. We decided to create a site that uses flashcards that contain real-world interview questions that we found online from Glassdoor and google searches of top interview questions in different langauges. Our site is designed to help anyone who is trying to get ready for a coding interview.
